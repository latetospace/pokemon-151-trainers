# 151 Trainers

**151 Trainers** is a static, client-side website that tracks collectors of the original 151 first-edition Pokémon cards.

The site displays all Gen 1 Pokémon, associates each with a trainer and card count, and aggregates totals into a live leaderboard. It is intentionally simple, transparent, and privacy-friendly.
